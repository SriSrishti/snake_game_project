# snake_game_project

Classic Arcade Game that we all have played at once in time á…³ The Snake Game. This game is about a Snake which eats food and grows larger but at the same time has to keep away from the walls and especially not to touch its own self. Creating the Snake Game with Python is great for getting some practice in some programming, and to learn about game development. 



Objectives 

This project aims to: 

Write a Snake Game: Program the retro Snake Game where the player directs a snake to eat and increase in size 

Game Mechanics: As described in the section about Game Mechanics, make sure the snake will keep moving continuously, eating food makes the snake grow, and if the snake collides with itself or the wall, the game will be over. 

Use Pygame Library: To graphics a work is done by Pygame Library
